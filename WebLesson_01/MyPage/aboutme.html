XHTML & CSS are the code standards that make websites work.  Websites at their most basic level are just text files.  The language of XHTML revolves around tags. There are opening and closing tags that contain everything on the website. The [head] includes info for the browser but the information in the head is not seen by the user of the site. The [body] is the actual site content like words, pictures, links, ect. </p>

HTML does not translate whit space like tabs or returns. The <p> </p> tag allows you to put text into paragraph form. Line Breaks [br/] add a single line break inside a paragraph tag so you donâ€™t need to make a new paragraph tag for each line you want to print. Horizontal Rule [hr/] adds a horizontal line that acts as a separator. [strong] tags makes text bold and [em] tag makes text italicized. </p>
	<h3><a name = "Adding Links"></a>Adding Links</h3>

[a][/a] is the anchor tag. This allows us to add links to our sites to other sites or to certain parts of our own site like Wikipedia does.
	<h3><a name = "Header"></a>Headers</h3>		
		<p>
The header allows you to change the size of your title from [h1] to [h6] where [h1] is the biggest font size and [h6] is the smallest. It looks like this: [h2]Header[/h2] [/p]

		<p>
Tool tips allow users to hover over elements of a page for further explanation of what they do.  For example, it may allow a user to know what a link will bring them to. To adjust the size of an image, you only need to adjust the height attribute if you want to keep the dimensions the same.</p>
